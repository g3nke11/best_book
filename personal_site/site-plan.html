		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<!-- change this -->
		<p>The purpose of my site is to provide recommendations for good books to read. This is to show books from
			various genres that range across both fiction and non-fiction.</p>

		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<!-- change this -->
		<p>My audience is primarily young adults who enjoy reading. The people most likely to enjoy the recommendations
			are older high schooler or college student age.</p>

		<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
		<!-- change this -->
		<p>My initial plans are to include two priamry dynamic elements for my recommendation pages. I intend to have
			the page display 2-3 random book recommendations each time the page is loaded. And I want to organize the
			pages so that fiction and non-fiction recommendations can be searched. This can be done by titles, tags, or
			descriptions.</p>

		<p>"All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened, and after you are

			the weather was." ― Ernest Hemingway</p>

			Pawn of Prophecy: The Pawn of Prophecy is a fantasy book written by David Eddings and published by Grim Oak
			Press. It is the first book in the Belgariad series, which contains a total of five main books with
			additional companion volumes.<br>
			Book Description from publisher: Long ago, so the Storyteller claimed, the evil god Torak sought dominion
			and drove men and gods to war. But Belgrath the Sorcerer led men to reclaim the Orb that protected the West.
			So long as it lay at Riva, the prophecy went, men would be safe. That was only a story, and Garion did not
			believe in magic dooms, even though the man without a shadow had haunted him for years. Brought up on a
			quiet farm by his Aunt Pol, how could he know that the Apostate planned to wake dread Torak, or that he
			would be led on a quest of unparalleled magic and danger by those he loved, but did not truly know.<br>
			For yet a little while, his dreams of innocence remained safe, untroubled by knowledge of his strange
			heritage. For a little while... thus begins The Belgariad, an epic fantasy of immense scope set against a
			history of 7,000 years. It tells of the struggles between ancient gods and mighty Kings, and of men in
			strange lands facing fated events, all bound by a prophecy that must be fulfilled.<br><br>

			Fablehaven: Fablehaven is a fantasy book written by Brandon Mull and published by Simon and Schuster.
			Fablehaven is the first book in the five volume Fablehaven series.<br>
			Book Description from publisher: For centuries mystical creatures of all description were gathered into a
			hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their extinction. The sanctuary survives today as one of the last
			strongholds of true magic. Enchanting? Absolutely. Exciting? You bet. Safe? Well, actually, quite the
			opposite.<br>
			Kendra and her brother, Seth, have no idea that their grandfather is the current caretaker of Fablehaven.
			Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting
			witches, spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get broken—Seth is a bit too curious
			and reckless for his own good—powerful forces of evil are unleashed, and Kendra and her brother face the
			greatest challenge of their lives. To save their family, Fablehaven, and perhaps even the world, Kendra and
			Seth must find the courage to do what they fear most.

			The Fellowship of the Ring: The Fellowship of the Ring was written by J.R.R. Tolkien and originally
			published by Allen & Unwin Book Publishers in 1954. This book is still a classic read along with the
			following two books in this three book series.<br>
			Book Description by publisher: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all
			and in darkness bind them.<br>
			In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the
			One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from
			him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into
			the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins
			finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo
			must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy
			the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.<br><br>
